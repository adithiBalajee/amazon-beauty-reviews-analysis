## Purpose of the Project

The purpose of this project is to analyze customer reviews of beauty products on Amazon to uncover insights about user sentiment, product ratings, and review trends. The dataset was sourced from the [Amazon Reviews 2023 repository](https://amazon-reviews-2023.github.io/) and filtered for the "All Beauty" category.

This project demonstrates the use of practical data science techniques, including data cleaning, sentiment analysis using TextBlob, exploratory data analysis, and data visualization. The analysis aims to explore how customers rate products, how review tone aligns with ratings, and what trends can be observed in review behavior.

The analysis addresses the following key questions:

1. Do verified purchase reviews differ in rating compared to unverified ones?
2. Are there temporal trends in reviews — do ratings trend higher or lower over time?
3. Which brands receive the most consistent ratings?¶
4. Is there a correlation between the sentiment of review text and the star rating?

Each question is answered programmatically, and the results are visualized using Seaborn and Matplotlib.
